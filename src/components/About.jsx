            <p className='about-text mt-4'>I love to write code to solve problems. I am driven by a desire to figure things out, find creative solutions and learn something new every day.</p>
            <p className='about-text mt-4'>5 years into my career as a Registered Nurse, I realized I wanted to make a drastic shift toward software development. My years as a nurse were foundational to who I am today. Collaborating with diverse teams taught me a lot about how to work with others. I learned how to communicate and ask thoughtful questions. I learned to do a lot with a little and to optimize for efficiency, but also to stay flexible and adapt to changing priorities. I learned to ask for help when I needed it, and always be the first to jump in to help someone else.</p>
            <p className='about-text mt-4'>Ultimately, it was my desire to tackle new challenges and engage my brain in a different way that led me to step away from nursing. My unconventional road to the software industry gives me unique perspective that I'm eager to share.</p>
